从我们产生一个想法，到它真正的实现，中间的过程应该是有迹可循并且有方法指导的。
首先是头脑风暴，这个阶段会产生很多点子，有的可行，有的可以参考，有的没有价值，他们彼此分散，没有联系。
这个阶段的任务就是找出有价值的点子，然后梳理好他们之间的关联关系，形象一点就是：用一根线把他们能串起来。
之后，就可以去一步步去实现了（思维链）。
总结：头脑风暴 - 捕获串联有价值的想法 - 实现。
值得注意的是，这个过程不是一次性的，中间实现阶段也要多次拆分，将一个复杂的、抽象的目标拆解成简单的、具体的子目标，然后再应用上述的处理过程。
这与最近我看 nand2Tertis 课程有关，一个如此复杂的计算机系统会有多层的抽象 layer，不同阶段只需要聚焦在特定的 layer 即可。不同的 layer 也有各自的抽象，直到最基础的 Nand gate。
再举个例子，理论是朴素的，抽象的，再复杂的算法，也可以用 大 O 来计算算法的复杂度。

The journey from conception to realization of an idea is traceable and methodical.

1. Brainstorming: In this phase, we generate numerous ideas. Some are feasible, some inspirational, while others may lack value. Initially, these ideas are often disconnected and scattered.
2. Filtering and Connecting: Our task is to identify valuable ideas and establish connections between them. Metaphorically, it's like stringing them together with a thread.
3. Implementation: With a clear roadmap, we can proceed to implement these ideas step by step (this process can be viewed as a chain of thought).

Summary: Brainstorming → Filtering and Connecting Valuable Ideas → Implementation.

It's important to note that this process is rarely linear. During the implementation phase, we often need to break down our objectives multiple times. Complex, abstract goals are decomposed into simpler, concrete sub-goals, each of which then undergoes the same process.

This approach resonates with the nand2tetris course I've been studying recently. When building a complex computer system, we encounter multiple layers of abstraction. At different stages, we focus only on specific abstraction layers. Each layer has its unique abstraction, all the way down to the fundamental NAND gate.

Another example is how even the most complex algorithms can be represented using Big O notation to express their time complexity. This demonstrates the inherent simplicity and abstraction in theoretical concepts.
