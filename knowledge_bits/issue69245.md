[npm run build fails even in newly created repo · Issue #69245 · vercel/next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/69245)

same issues.

spending me for nearly 3.5 hours
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useContext')
```

i tried may ways,
includes: 
- rebuild project
- adding any arguments of cli build command
- downgrading / upgrading next and react version
- changing client component into dynamic loading

all them failed.
finally after clear the original NODE\_ENV setting in Dockfile,

erors went away.
