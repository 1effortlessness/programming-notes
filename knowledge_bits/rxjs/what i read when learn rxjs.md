[is rxjs common used in React.js](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/11oge4h/is_rxjs_commonly_used_in_reactjs_for_reactive/)

answer is no, react.js has its own reactive system, and it's enough for most cases. rxjs is not the idiomatic way to handle reactive data flow in react.js, but it's still a good choice for complex data handling flow.

RxJS is good for certain situations. However, sometimes it can make things more complicated than they need to be. It has its benefits, but it can also make your code harder to understand and control.
