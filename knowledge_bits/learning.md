I think the most important for self-taught is that unable to set proper goals,
no goals, no way to find out that gaps you should fill.
i spent much time on learning how to learn English by books / reddit which is helpful indeed, but not very helpful.
Why teacher is important for learners, i think it out, they can make the learning curve easy and smooth, they can guide you the learning steps, communicating with you, figuring out you weakens, exam you level and adding appropriate difficulties in your learning way. That is the truth of teacher.
As a self-taughter, to achieve the nearly rate and effects, i have to find some goals. No goals no learning, event itâ€™s out of interests, it always has a goal.

1. Set SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) for your learning.
2. Seek out mentors or join learning communities to get feedback and guidance.
3. Regularly assess your progress and adjust your learning strategies.
4. Use a variety of resources and methods to make your learning more comprehensive.
5. Consider taking structured online courses or participating in language exchange programs to complement your self-study.

Based on your background as a 31-year-old full-stack engineer from Shanghai with an interest in technology, personal development, and a desire to improve your English skills, I can suggest a few potential goals that might be suitable for you, Vito.
