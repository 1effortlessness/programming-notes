describe what you want.

building a chatbot that can retrieve information for `programming-notes`.

say it another way: external attached a knowledge basee which all wrote by myself.

learning resources:

1. OpenAI's documentation for working with their models
2. Academic papers on RAG techniques
3. Tutorials on vector embeddings and semantic search
4. Node.js-specific resources for working with LLMs

```
4. Implement Basic RAG Functionality:
   - Create functions to read and parse your knowledge base
   - Implement a basic retrieval system (e.g., keyword matching or TF-IDF)
   - Learn about and implement vector embeddings for your documents (you can use libraries like tensorflow.js for this)

5. Integrate LLM with RAG:
   - Set up API calls to your chosen LLM
   - Implement a system to combine retrieved information with LLM prompts
   - Create a basic pipeline: query → retrieve relevant info → generate LLM prompt → get LLM response
```

# what is my first step or where to start?
