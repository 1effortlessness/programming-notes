What do I really want to do today?

1. learn about the `one-api` project [done]
there is a github repo named: [one-api](https://github.com/songquanpeng/one-api), it's a super agent for multiple LLM API like OpenAI, gemini, moonshot, etc.

it's a system out of box for using one api key managing all models, it is not suitable for personal usage.

2. routine work

- [x] reading little prince for 30 minutes
- [ ] watch a Youtube video in the reminder list

3. practice using MongoDB

learn by doing something with `Nest.js`
