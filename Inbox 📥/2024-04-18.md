## today's plan

### English
spare time listening English podcast and take some time read the captions created by Apple. list some new words or phrases.

watch a video "孙志立"

Check and remove unfamiliar words from the 1000 most basic English words in Anki.

The key is to use English, even if the grammar isn't perfect and the words are basic. This will help you get into the habit of thinking in English, which I believe is a major challenge for Chinese native speakers.

### programming

I have three high-priority tasks.

1. Be familiar with the basic operations with PostgreSQL and MongoDB
2. Be familiar with Nest.js, specially its unit tests.
3. Be familiar with docker

All of these descriptions are simply defining general ideas without any specific goals. I need to delve into them and list specific, measurable goals.

## others

Reduce the time you spend on Twitter. Consider YouTube, Reddit, and Hacker News as alternative choices.
