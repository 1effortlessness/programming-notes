# English learning
I've been working on my English by reading the book, 'Word Power Made Easy'. Learning English is my long-term goal and this book has helped me learn new vocabulary and word roots. 

There's no quick fix to improving my English skills; I need to surround myself with the language every day. I do this by reading books and articles, checking out Twitter and YouTube, and practicing writing. 

I make sure to use my spare time well, even if it's just a quick read during a break. Anki is a brilliant tool for memorizing new words.

# Computer science basic
As a programmer, having a solid foundation in computer science is essential for career advancement.

Recently, I have gained clarity through two principles:

	1.	Before starting, create a roadmap.
	2.	If it works, it works.

Using these principles, I have realized that my goal should be to build a comprehensive knowledge network in computer science through projects, books, and courses. I aim to understand concepts and how they relate to each other.

My strategy is bottom-up, starting with the hardware aspects of computers and progressing to my current field, web development.

Currently, I am attending the ‘Nand to Tetris’ course to gain a basic understanding of computer architecture. After this, I plan to learn C, followed by data structures and algorithms (DSA), operating systems, and Unix. This constitutes Stage 1.

Once I complete Stage 1, I will plan the next steps.
