notes:
- many studies have confirmed that smartphones can have a detrimental impact on our brains, including increased stress, anxiety, impaired attention, and altered cognitive function. these devices fundamentally change how our brains operate
- infinite information, algorithm to attract our attention, stop us from deep thinking
- the way to help use:
	- limit smartphone use to a specific duration each day
	- physical separation: place your phone in a different room while working or studying
	- avoid multitasking: don't attempt to do multiple tasks simultaneously, such as checking email, responding to a friend's message, browsing twitter, and then returning to read a book. the cost of switching contexts is significant; our brains, like computers, can become bogged down by task switching, which often becomes a bottleneck to efficiency
