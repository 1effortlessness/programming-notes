notes:
- author share her studying research about bilingual babies, which is the most easy way to handle two languages fluently, make them both their native language.
- baby should be exposed in bilingual environment as early as possible, 11 months for babies can produce word --- connect with the world.
- as parents both are not English speaker, it's more difficulty to make their baby to be bilingual, playing cartoons is helpless, baby need *interaction* with the physical world. they need feedback, it's important.
- how can i help my baby? play as his english father, it's luck that baby don't need to learn complicate vocabularies.
	- find early education places for him
