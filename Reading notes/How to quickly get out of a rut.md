## notes

1. inspiration leads to motivation, which in turn spurs action—this is the ideal process
2. inspiration, motivation, and action do not follow a strict sequence. inspiration can arise from taking action; this is a common occurrence
3. when i occasionally lack motivation or inspiration, i engage in simple, straightforward activities such as cleaning the house, washing dishes, taking a hot shower, going for a run, or having a conversation. these actions help restore order and often **spark** new inspiration
4. sparking doesn't come from your mind but your actions and conversations.
5. pushing yourself too hard can be counterproductive. simple rewards are crucial for both your brain and body. remember, rome wasn't built in a day. fantasizing about reading a book in a week like a genius will only lead to anxiety and self-abandonment
6. you can play video games, watch a movie, or buy something you enjoy as a reward for yourself
7. for actions, the most crucial aspect is a gradual process. it is essential to be realistic and allow muscles to recover after strenuous workouts through rest. once recovered, you can then aim for higher goals
8. by the way, i learn a new phrase: ==primal side of the brain==, don't be a slave driver to the primal side of your brain
