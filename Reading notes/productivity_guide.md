schedule The second law of thermodynamics. 
make your life plans, then it lose flexibility
following schedule is great, but it also cost energy

** Todo list **

- todo list: things must to be done
- watch list: check in the future
- later list: everything else

list things should be done, set a goal, 20%, 50%, try a measurable object;

don't save the todo cards, tear it up and throw it away, a good habit,
don't be a hoarder, tomorrow would be a fresh day;

3 ~ 5 things, the number seems okay;

utilizing procrastination to do the things in later/watch list;

check twitter/reddit/weibo twice a day;:wq
