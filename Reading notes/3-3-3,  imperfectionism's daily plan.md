note:
3 hours for work or other most important for you
3 things for trivial things
3 things for daily routine

it's really tough to stay focused on work for a long time, like 7 or 8 hours straight of coding, writing, or learning, unless you're naturally talented, have a strong passion, or are under a lot of pressure.
first, accept that you're ordinary, then stick to the right path, stay humble but be confident in your goals
