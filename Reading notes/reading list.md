- title: The Worst Programmer
- note: Paradoxically, the worst programmers can often be the best ones. This isn't as contradictory as it sounds. They tackle numerous complex issues, crafting layers of abstraction to meet business needs, while others might stick to simpler, less critical tasks like API design or testing. The crux is, the top performer in a team usually shoulders the majority of the workload. 
Initially, this means they're increasingly busy until eventually, the pressure becomes too much, leading to their departure. And that's when disaster strikes. Their code, often too complex for others to manage, can leave the project in ruins. Ironically, making them the 'worst' programmers in hindsight, despite their expertise. It's an absurd reality, but it happens.
